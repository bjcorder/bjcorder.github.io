# What is the NIST Risk Management Framework?

NIST SP 800-37 rev.2

# Risk Management Framework (RMF) Overview

The selection and specification of security controls for a system SHOULD BE accomplished as part of an organization-wide information security program that involves the management of organizational risk.

THE RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK PROVIDES A PROCESS THAT INTEGRATES SECURITY & RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES INTO THE SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT LIFE CYCLE.

# Risk-Based Approach

The risk-based approach to security control selection and specification considers effectiveness, efficiency, and constraints due to applicable laws, directives, Executive Orders, policies, standards, or regulations.

The following activities related to managing organizational risk are paramount to an effective information security program and can be applied to both new and egacy systems within the context of the system development life cycle:
1. Prepare Step
    * Prepare carries out essential activities at the organization, mission and business process, and information system levels of the enterprise to help prepare the organization to manage its security and privacy risks using the Risk Management Framework.
2. Categorize Step
    * Categorize the system and the information processed, stored, and transmitted by that system based on an impact analysis (*1).
3. Select Step
    * Select an initial set of baseline security controls for the system based on the security categorization; tailoring and supplementing the security control baseline as needed based on organization assessment of risk and local conditions.
4. Implement Step
    * Implement the security controls and document how the controls are deployed within the system and environment of operation.
5. Assess Step
    * Assess the security controls using appropriate procedures to determine the extent to which the controls are implemented correctly, operating as intended, and producing the desired outcome with respect to meeting the security requirements for the system.
6. Authorize Step
    * Authorize system operation based upon a determination of the risk to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations and the Nation resulting from the operation of the system and the decision that this risk is acceptable (*2).
7. Monitor Step
    * Monitor and assess selected security controls in the system on an ongoing basis including assessing security control effectiveness, documenting changes to the system or environment of operation, conducting security impact analyses of the associated changes, and reporting the security state of the system to appropriate organizational officials (*3).
