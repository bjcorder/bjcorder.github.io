# Overview of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)

In December 2015 the process of agreeing to new legislation designed to reform the legal framework for ensuring the rights of EU residents to enhanced privacy protections was completed. This was ratified in early 2016 and became widely enforceable on the 25th May 2018.

The reforms consist of two instruments:

1. The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) which is designed to enable individuals to better control their personal data.
2. The Data Protection Directive which is designed to enable the police and criminal justice sectors to ensure that the data of victims, witnesses, and suspects of crimes are duly protected in the context of a criminal investigation or a law enforcement action.

# Key Components of the GDPR

Harmonization across and beyond the EU - The regulation is intended to establish one single set of rules across Europe making it simpler and cheaper for organizations to do business across the Union. Organizations outside the EU are subject to the jurisdiction of the EU regulators just by collecting data concerning an EU resident.

# What is “Personal Data”?

“Personal data” is defined in both the Directive and the GDPR as any information relating to an person who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that person.

As a result, in many cases online identifiers including IP address and cookies will now be regarded as personal data if they can be (or are capable of being) linked back to the data subject.

There is no distinction between personal data about individuals in their private, public or work roles – the person is the person.

# Controllers and Processors

The Regulation separates responsibilities and duties of data controllers and processors, obligating controllers to engage only those processors that provide “sufficient guarantees to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures” to meet the Regulation’s requirements and protect data subjects’ rights.

Controllers and processors are required to “implement appropriate technical and organisational measures” taking into account “the state of the art and the costs of implementation” and “the nature, scope, context, and purposes of the processing as well as the risk of varying likelihood and severity for the rights and freedoms of individuals.”

The regulation provides specific suggestions for what kinds of security actions might be considered “appropriate to the risk,” including:
* The pseudonymisation and/or encryption of personal data
* The ability to ensure the ongoing confidentiality, integrity, availability
and resilience of systems and services processing personal data
* The ability to restore the availability and access to data in a timely
manner in the event of a physical or technical incident
* A process for regularly testing, assessing and evaluating the effectiveness of technical and organizational measures for ensuring the security of the processing

Controllers and processors that adhere to either an approved code of conduct or an approved certification may use these tools to demonstrate compliance.

The controller processor relationships must be documented and managed with contracts that mandate privacy obligations – however, ultimately controllers must assure themselves of processors privacy capabilities.

# Fines and Enforcement

Regulators will now have authority to issue penalties equal to the greater of €10 million or 2% of the entity's global gross revenue for violations of record-keeping, security, breach notification, and privacy impact assessment obligations.

Violations of obligations related to legal justification for processing (including consent), data subject rights, and cross-border data transfers may result in penalties of the greater of €20 million or 4% of the entity's global gross revenue.

# Data Protection Officers

Data Protection Officers must be appointed for all public authorities, and where the core activities of the controller or the processor involve “regular and systematic monitoring of data subjects on a large scale” or where the entity conducts large-scale processing of “special categories of personal data” (such as that revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, and the like).

*Note: Although an early draft of the GDPR limited mandatory data protection
officer appointment to organizations with more than 250 employees, the final
version has no such restriction.*

The regulation requires that they have “expert knowledge of data protection law and practices.” The level of which “should be determined in particular according to the data processing operations carried out and the protection required for the personal data processed by the controller or the processor.”

The data protection officer’s tasks are also delineated in the regulation to include:
* Informing and advising the controller or processor and its employees of
their obligations to comply with the GDPR and other data protection laws
* Monitoring compliance including managing internal data protection activities,
training data processing staff, and conducting internal audits
* Advising with regard to data protection impact assessments when required
under Article 33
* Working and cooperating with the controller’s or processor’s designated
supervisory authority and serving as the contact point for the supervisory
authority on issues relating to the processing of personal data
* Being available for inquiries from data subjects on issues relating to
data protection practices, withdrawal of consent, the right to be forgotten,
and related rights

Data Protection Officers may insist upon company resources to fulfill their job functions and for their own ongoing training.

They must have access to the company’s data processing personnel and operations, significant independence in the performance of their roles, and a direct reporting line “to the highest management level” of the company.

The regulation expressly prevents dismissal or censure of the data protection officer for performance of his/her tasks and places no limitation on the length of their tenure.

A company with multiple subsidiaries may appoint a single data protection officer so long as they are “easily accessible from each establishment.”

The GDPR also allows the data protection officer functions to be performed by either an employee of the controller or processor or by a third party service provider.

# Privacy Management

The regulation mandates a “Risk Based Approach:” where the appropriate organizational controls must be developed according to the degree of risk associated with the processing activities.

Where appropriate, privacy impact assessments must be made – with the focus on protecting data subject rights.

Data protection safeguards must be designed into products and services from the earliest stage of development – Privacy by Design.

There is an increased emphasis on record keeping for controllers – designed to help demonstrate and meet compliance with the regulation and improve the capabilities of organizations to manage privacy and data effectively. There is an exclusion for small businesses (less than 250 staff) where data processing is not a significant risk.

# Consent

A basis for legal processing (along with legitimate interests, necessary execution of a contract and others). According to the Regulation consent means “any freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous indication of his or her wishes by which the data subject, either by a statement or by a clear affirmative action, signifies agreement to personal data relating to them being processed;”

The purposes for which the consent is gained does need to be “collected for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes”. In other words it needs to be obvious to the data subject what their data is going to be used for at the point of data collection.
* Consent should be demonstrable – organizations need to be able to show
clearly how consent was gained and when.
* Consent must be freely given – a controller cannot insist on data that’s not
required for the performance of a contract as a pre-requisite for that contract.
* Withdrawing consent should always be possible – and should be as easy as
giving it.

# Information Provided at Data Collection

The information that must be made available to a Data Subject when data is collected has been strongly defined and includes;
* the identity and the contact details of the controller and DPO
* the purposes of the processing for which the personal data are intended
* the legal basis of the processing
* where applicable, the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by
a third party
* where applicable, the recipients or categories of recipients of the personal
data
* where applicable, that the controller intends to transfer personal data
internationally
* the period for which the personal data will be stored, or if this is not
possible, the criteria used to determine this period
* the existence of the right to access, rectify or erase the personal data
* the right to data portability
* the right to withdraw consent at any time
* and the right to lodge a complaint to a supervisory authority

Where the data has not been obtained directly from the data subject the list varies and includes:
* From which source the personal data originate
* The existence of any profiling and meaningful information about the logic
involved, as well as the significance and the envisaged consequences of such
processing for the data subject

There are some exceptions – notably where the effort would be disproportionate and, where the information has already been provided to the data subject.

# Profiling

Any automated processing of personal data to determine certain criteria about a person. “In particular to analyse or predict aspects concerning that natural person' s performance at work, economic situation, health, personal preferences, interests, reliability, behaviour, location or movements”.

Individuals have the right not to be subject to the results of automated decision making, including profiling. So, individuals can opt out of profiling.

Automated decision making will be legal where individuals have explicitly consented to it, or if profiling is necessary under a contract between an organization and an individual, or if profiling is authorized by EU or Member State Law.

# Legitimate Interests & Direct Marketing

The regulation specifically recognizes that the processing of data for “direct marketing purposes” can be considered as a legitimate interest. Legitimate interest is one of the grounds, like consent, that an organization can use in order to process data and satisfy the principle that data has been fairly and lawfully processed.

The act says that processing is lawful if “processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third party, except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require protection of personal data, in particular where the data subject is a child.”

# Breach & Notification

According to the regulation a “personal data breach” is “a breach of security leading to the accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure of, or access to, personal data transmitted, stored or otherwise processed”

It’s important to note that the willful destruction or alteration of data is as much a breach as theft.

In the event of a personal data breach data controllers must notify the appropriate supervisory authority “without undue delay and, where feasible, not later than 72 hours after having become aware of it.” If notification is not made within 72 hours, the controller must provide a “reasoned justification” for the delay.

Notice is not required if “the personal data breach is unlikely to result in a risk for the rights and freedoms of individuals,” How this translates into real-world action is not clear however.

Importantly when a data processor experiences a personal data breach, it must notify the controller but otherwise has no other notification or reporting obligation.

Should the controller determine that the personal data breach “is likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of individuals,” it must also communicate information regarding the personal data breach to the affected data subjects. Under Article 32, this must be done “without undue delay.”

The GDPR provides exceptions to this additional requirement to notify data subjects in the following circumstances:
1. The controller has “implemented appropriate technical and organisational
protection measures” that “render the data unintelligible to any person who is
not authorised to access it, such as encryption”
2. The controller takes actions subsequent to the personal data breach to
“ensure that the high risk for the rights and freedoms of data subjects” is
unlikely to materialize.
3. When notification to each data subject would “involve disproportionate
effort,” in which case alternative communication measures may be used.

# Data Subject Access Requests

Individuals will have more information on how their data is processed and this information should be available in a clear and understandable way.

DSAR’s must be executed “without undue delay and at the latest within one month of receipt of the request.”

Subject access requests must also give all the information relating to purposes that should have been provided upon collection.

# The Right to Data Portability

Focused on helping drive competition between service providers this part of the regulation seeks to drive automated transfers of data (using a common format yet to be defined) between services which primarily process customers automatically.

# Retention & The Right to be Forgotten

Controllers must inform subjects of the period of time (or reasons why) data will be retained on collection. Should the data subject subsequently wish to have their data removed and the data is no longer required for the reasons for which it was collected then it must be erased.

*Note: there is a “downstream” responsibility for controllers to take
“reasonable steps” to notify processors and other downstream data recipients
of such requests.*

# A brief introduction to the E-Privacy Regulation and why GDPR needs this:

Known by many names including ePrivacy, ePrivacy2, PECR2 and ePR this regulation will replaces the existing EU Directive and is designed to harmonize and enhance the GDPR. Like the GDPR it has global reach and similarly significant penalties for non-compliance. In the UK this regulation will replace the exiting PECR laws.

This legislation is designed to regulate the use of personal information across all electronic communications including telephony.

This legislation is still in draft with the latest version issued on the 9th September 2017. This version still proposed the law going live simultaneously with GDPR becoming enforceable on the 25th May 2018.

This regulation is particularly important for digital marketing activity as it overrides the GDPR's allowance for legitimate interests and enforces consent on all digital communications for marketing purposes. There will still be an allowance for the so called "soft opt-in" where customers can be communicated to about similar goods and services with an opt-out only, but it should be noted that the wording here has been tightened restricting the use to customers only.

Cookies and similar tracking technologies, when used for non-essential processes (like profiling and advertising) will require prior consent. Browser and interface manufacturers are set to bear the burden of responsibility here by providing new mechanisms to allow individuals to manage their consent more easily. The goal is to lead to much more open dialogue between advertisers and data subjects - with advertisers needing to make much clearer the "value exchange".

# What information does the GDPR apply to?

## Personal data

Like the DPA, the GDPR applies to ‘personal data’. However, the GDPR’s definition is more detailed and makes it clear that information such as an online identifier can be personal data. The more expansive definition provides for a wide range of personal identifiers to constitute personal data.

You can assume that if you hold information that falls within the scope of the DPA, it will also fall within the scope of the GDPR.

The GDPR applies to both automated personal data and to manual filing systems where personal data are accessible according to specific criteria. This is wider than the DPA’s definition and could include chronologically ordered sets of manual records containing personal data.

*Note: Personal data that has been pseudonymised can fall within the scope of the GDPR depending on how difficult it is to attribute the pseudonym to a particular individual.*

## Sensitive personal data

The GDPR refers to sensitive personal data as “special categories of personal data” (see Article 9). These categories are broadly the same as those in the DPA, but there are some minor changes.

For example, the special categories specifically include genetic data, and biometric data where processed to uniquely identify an individual.

Personal data relating to criminal convictions and offences are not included, but similar extra safeguards apply to its processing (see Article 10).
