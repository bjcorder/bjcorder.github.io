# TOGAF

Partitioning – a number of techniques and considerations on how to partition
the various architectures within an enterprise.

Architecture Repository – a logical information model for an Architecture
Repository which can be used as an integrated store for all outputs created by
executing the Architecture Development Method (ADM).

Capability Framework – a structured definition of the organization, skills,
roles, and responsibilities required to operate an effective enterprise
architecture capability. The TOGAF standard also provides guidance on a process
that can be followed to identify and establish an appropriate architecture
capability.

What Kinds of Architecture does the TOGAF Standard Deal with?

Business Architecture - The business strategy, governance, organization, and key business processes.

Data Architecture - The structure of an organization’s logical and physical data assets and data management resources.

Application Architecture - A blueprint for the individual applications to be deployed, their interactions, and their relationships to the core business processes of the organization.

Technology Architecture - The logical software and hardware capabilities that are required to support the deployment of business, data, and application services. This includes IT infrastructure, middleware, networks, communications, processing, and standards.
