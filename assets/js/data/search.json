Preparedness - Develop and implement a contingency plan in case of an emergency. Response - Execute on your contingency plan in order to reduce the impact of the disruptive event. Recovery - Resume operations and get things running at normal capacity as quickly as possible. Manage environmental risk in your supply chain - single vs. multi supplier Supply chain risk assessment software enables you to take a proactive approach to risk management by providing you with greater visibility into the structure of your supply chain. With such a solution, you will be able to identify weak points in your supply chain and receive data-driven insights into how you can strengthen them. Improve your cyber supply chain risk management: Establish compliance standards for all third-party vendors, including manufacturers, suppliers, and distributors. Define user roles and implement security controls to restrict who is able to access your system and what level of clearance they are given. Perform a thorough vendor risk assessment prior to signing any contracts. Implement data stewardship standards that define who owns certain data and what they are able to do with that data. Provide comprehensive training for all employees about cybersecurity protocols. Implement a software solution that provides you with total visibility into your supply chain, so you can quickly identify unusual activity. Work with vendors in your supply chain network to develop a unified disaster recovery plan to ensure business continuity. Establish backup controls to safeguard your data backups. Regularly update your company’s anti-virus, anti-spyware, and firewall software solutions, as well as look into more advanced cybersecurity measures, such as DNS filtering and network access control. Gain visibility into suppliers’ financial stability Track the right freight carrier metrics: Transit Time - the number of hours or days it takes for a shipment to arrive at the customer’s location after leaving your facility. Number of Stops &amp; Average Stop Time - The more stops a freight carrier takes in route to delivering a shipment, the longer it will take your product to reach your customer. Even if a route only includes a few stops, a long average stop time could still jeopardize on-time delivery and disrupt your supply chain. These metrics are important to monitor for the sake of supply chain efficiency. [Note: It’s important to look for a low number of stops and low average stop time while still being mindful of drivers’ legally regulated hours of service.] Average Loading Time - This refers to the amount of time it takes to load a carrier with freight, as well as fill out any necessary paperwork, once it has arrived at the loading dock. Like the previous item on this list, this is a key indicator of supply chain efficiency. Route Optimization - It’s important that retailers consider how field carriers optimize routes for fuel usage and travel time because these have a direct effect on supply chain costs and efficiency. If a retailer has its own fleet, it can monitor this metric closely; if it partners with a third-party carrier, it can monitor this metric through costs charged for shipping. Maintenance Schedule - A freight carrier with a consistent maintenance schedule is less likely to break down, which can prevent unnecessary supply chain disruption. Implement a logistics contingency plan - Similar to an emergency response plan, it’s imperative that retailers have a logistics contingency plan in place to ensure business continuity in the event of supply chain disruption. Some tips when creating a contingency plan for supply chain risk mitigation: Map out your supply chain to get a clear understanding of which entities are most vulnerable to risk. Perform a full assessment of suppliers based on factors such as political risk, geographic risk, and economic risk. Diversify your supplier network so that you are not reliant on a single supplier. Audit logistics providers based on their disaster plans. Establish a crisis response team to make critical decisions in the event of an emergency. Develop solid communications channels so that your employees know what their responsibilities are in the event of supply chain disruption. Carefully document all processes and create a single source of truth that employees can refer to when executing on your contingency plan. Stay up to date on current events and adapt your contingency plan accordingly. Conduct internal risk awareness training - Management is not the only area of your organization that can assist in supply chain risk mitigation. In fact, building a risk-aware culture requires buy-in at all levels of your business. The easiest way to achieve this is to conduct risk awareness training for your entire workforce. Training curriculum should include the following: Common supply chain management risks and challenges Risk management best practices Computer and internet best practices to improve cybersecurity awareness Supply chain risk assessment software training to encourage end user adoption Consistently monitor risk Use data to model key risk event scenarios Consolidate your data for easy access Security Awareness Education &amp; Training Program Establishing an understanding of the importance of, and need to, comply with security policies within the organization Addresses the “WHY” of policy: Methods and techniques to present awareness and training Periodic content reviews Program effectiveness evaluation Program means nothing if it does not prove its effectiveness " }, { "title": "CISSP 2021 - Risk Management Framework", "url": "/posts/CISSP-RiskManagementFramework/", "categories": "certification", "tags": "certification, cissp, notes", "date": "2022-08-14 05:00:00 -0500", "snippet": "What is the NIST Risk Management Framework?NIST SP 800-37 rev.2Risk Management Framework (RMF) OverviewThe selection and specification of security controls for a system SHOULD BE accomplished as part of an organization-wide information security program that involves the management of organizational risk.THE RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK PROVIDES A PROCESS THAT INTEGRATES SECURITY &amp; RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES INTO THE SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT LIFE CYCLE.Risk-Based ApproachThe risk-based approach to security control selection and specification considers effectiveness, efficiency, and constraints due to applicable laws, directives, Executive Orders, policies, standards, or regulations.The following activities related to managing organizational risk are paramount to an effective information security program and can be applied to both new and egacy systems within the context of the system development life cycle: Prepare Step Prepare carries out essential activities at the organization, mission and business process, and information system levels of the enterprise to help prepare the organization to manage its security and privacy risks using the Risk Management Framework. Categorize Step Categorize the system and the information processed, stored, and transmitted by that system based on an impact analysis (*1). Select Step Select an initial set of baseline security controls for the system based on the security categorization; tailoring and supplementing the security control baseline as needed based on organization assessment of risk and local conditions. Implement Step Implement the security controls and document how the controls are deployed within the system and environment of operation. Assess Step Assess the security controls using appropriate procedures to determine the extent to which the controls are implemented correctly, operating as intended, and producing the desired outcome with respect to meeting the security requirements for the system. Authorize Step Authorize system operation based upon a determination of the risk to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations and the Nation resulting from the operation of the system and the decision that this risk is acceptable (*2). Monitor Step Monitor and assess selected security controls in the system on an ongoing basis including assessing security control effectiveness, documenting changes to the system or environment of operation, conducting security impact analyses of the associated changes, and reporting the security state of the system to appropriate organizational officials (*3).

The DREAD algorithm, shown below, is used to compute a risk value, which is an average of all five categories.Risk_DREAD = (DAMAGE + REPRODUCIBILITY + EXPLOITABILITY + AFFECTED USERS + DISCOVERABILITY) / 5The calculation always produces a number between 0 and 10; the higher the number, the more serious the risk.P.A.S.T.AProcess for Attack Simulation and Threat Analysis (PASTA). A seven-step process for aligning business objectives and technical requirements, taking into account compliance issues and business analysis.

Finally, appropriate security controls can be enumerated.Provides an attacker-centric view of the application and infrastructure from which defenders can develop an asset-centric mitigation strategy.TrikeCredit to EC-Council for this sectionTRIKE is an open-source threat modeling methodology that is used when security auditing from a risk management perspective. TRIKE threat modeling is a fusion of two models namely – Requirement Model and Implementations Model. The requirement model is the base of TRIKE modeling that explains the security characteristics of an IT system and assigns acceptable levels of risk to each asset. This model also enables coordination among different security teams and stakeholders by providing a conceptual framework. After this comes the implementation model. In this model, a Data Flow Diagram (DFD) is created to illustrate the flow of data and the user performed actions within a system. In this model, threats are analyzed to enumerate and assign a risk value. Based on this, security controls or preventive measures defined to address the threats as per the priority and assigned risks.VASTVisual, Agile, and Simple Threat modeling. Focuses on the necessity of scaling the threat modeling process across the infrastructure and entire SDLC, and integrating it seamlessly into an Agile software development methodology.

Evaluate the Risks: Determine the residual risk. Treat the Risks: Describe the method to treat the risks so that risks selected by the business will be mitigated.Note: AS/NZS 4360 assumes that risk will be managed by an operational risk group, and that the organization has adequate skills and risk management resources in house to identify, analyze, and treat the risks." }, { "title": "CISSP 2021 - GDPR", "url": "/posts/CISSP-GDPR/", "categories": "certification", "tags": "certification, cissp, notes", "date": "2022-08-14 02:00:00 -0500", "snippet": "Overview of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)In December 2015 the process of agreeing to new legislation designed to reform the legal framework for ensuring the rights of EU residents to enhanced privacy protections was completed. This was ratified in early 2016 and became widely enforceable on the 25th May 2018.The reforms consist of two instruments: The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) which is designed to enable individuals to better control their personal data. The Data Protection Directive which is designed to enable the police and criminal justice sectors to ensure that the data of victims, witnesses, and suspects of crimes are duly protected in the context of a criminal investigation or a law enforcement action.Key Components of the GDPRHarmonization across and beyond the EU - The regulation is intended to establish one single set of rules across Europe making it simpler and cheaper for organizations to do business across the Union. Organizations outside the EU are subject to the jurisdiction of the EU regulators just by collecting data concerning an EU resident.What is “Personal Data”?“Personal data” is defined in both the Directive and the GDPR as any information relating to an person who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that person.As a result, in many cases online identifiers including IP address and cookies will now be regarded as personal data if they can be (or are capable of being) linked back to the data subject.There is no distinction between personal data about individuals in their private, public or work roles – the person is the person.Controllers and ProcessorsThe Regulation separates responsibilities and duties of data controllers and processors, obligating controllers to engage only those processors that provide “sufficient guarantees to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures” to meet the Regulation’s requirements and protect data subjects’ rights.Controllers and processors are required to “implement appropriate technical and organisational measures” taking into account “the state of the art and the costs of implementation” and “the nature, scope, context, and purposes of the processing as well as the risk of varying likelihood and severity for the rights and freedoms of individuals.”The regulation provides specific suggestions for what kinds of security actions might be considered “appropriate to the risk,” including: The pseudonymisation and/or encryption of personal data The ability to ensure the ongoing confidentiality, integrity, availabilityand resilience of systems and services processing personal data The ability to restore the availability and access to data in a timelymanner in the event of a physical or technical incident A process for regularly testing, assessing and evaluating the effectiveness of technical and organizational measures for ensuring the security of the processingControllers and processors that adhere to either an approved code of conduct or an approved certification may use these tools to demonstrate compliance.The controller processor relationships must be documented and managed with contracts that mandate privacy obligations – however, ultimately controllers must assure themselves of processors privacy capabilities.Fines and EnforcementRegulators will now have authority to issue penalties equal to the greater of €10 million or 2% of the entity’s global gross revenue for violations of record-keeping, security, breach notification, and privacy impact assessment obligations.Violations of obligations related to legal justification for processing (including consent), data subject rights, and cross-border data transfers may result in penalties of the greater of €20 million or 4% of the entity’s global gross revenue.Data Protection OfficersData Protection Officers must be appointed for all public authorities, and where the core activities of the controller or the processor involve “regular and systematic monitoring of data subjects on a large scale” or where the entity conducts large-scale processing of “special categories of personal data” (such as that revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, and the like).Note: Although an early draft of the GDPR limited mandatory data protectionofficer appointment to organizations with more than 250 employees, the finalversion has no such restriction.The regulation requires that they have “expert knowledge of data protection law and practices.” The level of which “should be determined in particular according to the data processing operations carried out and the protection required for the personal data processed by the controller or the processor.”The data protection officer’s tasks are also delineated in the regulation to include: Informing and advising the controller or processor and its employees oftheir obligations to comply with the GDPR and other data protection laws Monitoring compliance including managing internal data protection activities,training data processing staff, and conducting internal audits Advising with regard to data protection impact assessments when requiredunder Article 33 Working and cooperating with the controller’s or processor’s designatedsupervisory authority and serving as the contact point for the supervisoryauthority on issues relating to the processing of personal data Being available for inquiries from data subjects on issues relating todata protection practices, withdrawal of consent, the right to be forgotten,and related rightsData Protection Officers may insist upon company resources to fulfill their job functions and for their own ongoing training.They must have access to the company’s data processing personnel and operations, significant independence in the performance of their roles, and a direct reporting line “to the highest management level” of the company.The regulation expressly prevents dismissal or censure of the data protection officer for performance of his/her tasks and places no limitation on the length of their tenure.A company with multiple subsidiaries may appoint a single data protection officer so long as they are “easily accessible from each establishment.”The GDPR also allows the data protection officer functions to be performed by either an employee of the controller or processor or by a third party service provider.Privacy ManagementThe regulation mandates a “Risk Based Approach:” where the appropriate organizational controls must be developed according to the degree of risk associated with the processing activities.Where appropriate, privacy impact assessments must be made – with the focus on protecting data subject rights.Data protection safeguards must be designed into products and services from the earliest stage of development – Privacy by Design.There is an increased emphasis on record keeping for controllers – designed to help demonstrate and meet compliance with the regulation and improve the capabilities of organizations to manage privacy and data effectively. There is an exclusion for small businesses (less than 250 staff) where data processing is not a significant risk.ConsentA basis for legal processing (along with legitimate interests, necessary execution of a contract and others). According to the Regulation consent means “any freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous indication of his or her wishes by which the data subject, either by a statement or by a clear affirmative action, signifies agreement to personal data relating to them being processed;”The purposes for which the consent is gained does need to be “collected for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes”. In other words it needs to be obvious to the data subject what their data is going to be used for at the point of data collection. Consent should be demonstrable – organizations need to be able to showclearly how consent was gained and when. Consent must be freely given – a controller cannot insist on data that’s notrequired for the performance of a contract as a pre-requisite for that contract. Withdrawing consent should always be possible – and should be as easy asgiving it.Information Provided at Data CollectionThe information that must be made available to a Data Subject when data is collected has been strongly defined and includes; the identity and the contact details of the controller and DPO the purposes of the processing for which the personal data are intended the legal basis of the processing where applicable, the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or bya third party where applicable, the recipients or categories of recipients of the personaldata where applicable, that the controller intends to transfer personal datainternationally the period for which the personal data will be stored, or if this is notpossible, the criteria used to determine this period the existence of the right to access, rectify or erase the personal data the right to data portability the right to withdraw consent at any time and the right to lodge a complaint to a supervisory authorityWhere the data has not been obtained directly from the data subject the list varies and includes: From which source the personal data originate The existence of any profiling and meaningful information about the logicinvolved, as well as the significance and the envisaged consequences of suchprocessing for the data subjectThere are some exceptions – notably where the effort would be disproportionate and, where the information has already been provided to the data subject.ProfilingAny automated processing of personal data to determine certain criteria about a person. “In particular to analyse or predict aspects concerning that natural person’ s performance at work, economic situation, health, personal preferences, interests, reliability, behaviour, location or movements”.Individuals have the right not to be subject to the results of automated decision making, including profiling. So, individuals can opt out of profiling.Automated decision making will be legal where individuals have explicitly consented to it, or if profiling is necessary under a contract between an organization and an individual, or if profiling is authorized by EU or Member State Law.Legitimate Interests &amp; Direct MarketingThe regulation specifically recognizes that the processing of data for “direct marketing purposes” can be considered as a legitimate interest. Legitimate interest is one of the grounds, like consent, that an organization can use in order to process data and satisfy the principle that data has been fairly and lawfully processed.The act says that processing is lawful if “processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third party, except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require protection of personal data, in particular where the data subject is a child.”Breach &amp; NotificationAccording to the regulation a “personal data breach” is “a breach of security leading to the accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure of, or access to, personal data transmitted, stored or otherwise processed”It’s important to note that the willful destruction or alteration of data is as much a breach as theft.In the event of a personal data breach data controllers must notify the appropriate supervisory authority “without undue delay and, where feasible, not later than 72 hours after having become aware of it.” If notification is not made within 72 hours, the controller must provide a “reasoned justification” for the delay.Notice is not required if “the personal data breach is unlikely to result in a risk for the rights and freedoms of individuals,” How this translates into real-world action is not clear however.Importantly when a data processor experiences a personal data breach, it must notify the controller but otherwise has no other notification or reporting obligation.Should the controller determine that the personal data breach “is likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of individuals,” it must also communicate information regarding the personal data breach to the affected data subjects. Under Article 32, this must be done “without undue delay.”The GDPR provides exceptions to this additional requirement to notify data subjects in the following circumstances: The controller has “implemented appropriate technical and organisationalprotection measures” that “render the data unintelligible to any person who isnot authorised to access it, such as encryption” The controller takes actions subsequent to the personal data breach to“ensure that the high risk for the rights and freedoms of data subjects” isunlikely to materialize. When notification to each data subject would “involve disproportionateeffort,” in which case alternative communication measures may be used.Data Subject Access RequestsIndividuals will have more information on how their data is processed and this information should be available in a clear and understandable way.DSAR’s must be executed “without undue delay and at the latest within one month of receipt of the request.”Subject access requests must also give all the information relating to purposes that should have been provided upon collection.The Right to Data PortabilityFocused on helping drive competition between service providers this part of the regulation seeks to drive automated transfers of data (using a common format yet to be defined) between services which primarily process customers automatically.Retention &amp; The Right to be ForgottenControllers must inform subjects of the period of time (or reasons why) data will be retained on collection. Should the data subject subsequently wish to have their data removed and the data is no longer required for the reasons for which it was collected then it must be erased.Note: there is a “downstream” responsibility for controllers to take“reasonable steps” to notify processors and other downstream data recipientsof such requests.A brief introduction to the E-Privacy Regulation and why GDPR needs this:Known by many names including ePrivacy, ePrivacy2, PECR2 and ePR this regulation will replaces the existing EU Directive and is designed to harmonize and enhance the GDPR. Like the GDPR it has global reach and similarly significant penalties for non-compliance. In the UK this regulation will replace the exiting PECR laws.This legislation is designed to regulate the use of personal information across all electronic communications including telephony.This legislation is still in draft with the latest version issued on the 9th September 2017. This version still proposed the law going live simultaneously with GDPR becoming enforceable on the 25th May 2018.This regulation is particularly important for digital marketing activity as it overrides the GDPR’s allowance for legitimate interests and enforces consent on all digital communications for marketing purposes. There will still be an allowance for the so called “soft opt-in” where customers can be communicated to about similar goods and services with an opt-out only, but it should be noted that the wording here has been tightened restricting the use to customers only.Cookies and similar tracking technologies, when used for non-essential processes (like profiling and advertising) will require prior consent. Browser and interface manufacturers are set to bear the burden of responsibility here by providing new mechanisms to allow individuals to manage their consent more easily. The goal is to lead to much more open dialogue between advertisers and data subjects - with advertisers needing to make much clearer the “value exchange”.What information does the GDPR apply to?Personal dataLike the DPA, the GDPR applies to ‘personal data’. However, the GDPR’s definition is more detailed and makes it clear that information such as an online identifier can be personal data. The more expansive definition provides for a wide range of personal identifiers to constitute personal data.You can assume that if you hold information that falls within the scope of the DPA, it will also fall within the scope of the GDPR.The GDPR applies to both automated personal data and to manual filing systems where personal data are accessible according to specific criteria. This is wider than the DPA’s definition and could include chronologically ordered sets of manual records containing personal data.Note: Personal data that has been pseudonymised can fall within the scope of the GDPR depending on how difficult it is to attribute the pseudonym to a particular individual.Sensitive personal dataThe GDPR refers to sensitive personal data as “special categories of personal data” (see Article 9). These categories are broadly the same as those in the DPA, but there are some minor changes.For example, the special categories specifically include genetic data, and biometric data where processed to uniquely identify an individual.Personal data relating to criminal convictions and offences are not included, but similar extra safeguards apply to its processing (see Article 10)." }, { "title": "Installing CrowdSec Agent", "url": "/posts/CrowdSec-Install/", "categories": "documentation, configuration", "tags": "security, crowdsec", "date": "2022-08-11 11:00:00 -0500", "snippet": "Operating System: Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.6Operating System: Ubuntu Server 22.04InstallationRed Hat Enterprise Linux 8.6Install the CrowdSec repositories to get access to the most recent packages for the CrowdSec agent and Bouncers:curl -s https://packagecloud.io/install/repositories/crowdsec/crowdsec/script.rpm.sh | sudo bashInstall the CrowdSec agent from the repository:sudo dnf install crowdsecInstall the basic firewall Bouncer:sudo dnf install crowdsec-firewall-bouncer-iptablesFinally, enroll the instance to your CrowdSec account:sudo cscli console enroll {YOUR_INSTANCE_TOKEN}Ubuntu Server 22.04Install the CrowdSec repositories to get access to the most recent packages for the CrowdSec agent and Bouncers:curl -s https://packagecloud.io/install/repositories/crowdsec/crowdsec/script.deb.sh | sudo bashInstall the CrowdSec agent from the repository:sudo apt install crowdsecInstall the basic firewall Bouncer:sudo apt install crowdsec-firewall-bouncer-iptablesFinally, enroll the instance to your CrowdSec account:sudo cscli console enroll {YOUR_INSTANCE_TOKEN}" }, { "title": "Installing the XCP-NG Guest Tools", "url": "/posts/XCP-NG-Guest-Tools-Install/", "categories": "documentation, configuration", "tags": "rhel, linux, os, repo, ubuntu, xcp-ng", "date": "2022-08-11 10:00:00 -0500", "snippet": "Operating System: Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.6Operating System: Ubuntu Server 22.04InstallationRed Hat Enterprise Linux 8.6Make sure that the EPEL repositories have been installed as shown in this post.First, update all of your repositories:sudo yum updateInstall the Guest Utilities from the EPEL repository:sudo yum install xe-guest-utilities-latestFinally, make sure to enable and start the Guest Utilities service, and then reboot the system.sudo systemctl enable xe-linux-distributionsudo systemctl start xe-linux-distributionsudo reboot nowUbuntu Server 22.04First, update all of your repositories and upgrade all packages:sudo apt update &amp;&amp; sudo apt upgrade -yInstall the Guest Utilities:sudo apt install xe-guest-utilitiesOnce completed, restart the server:sudo reboot now" }, { "title": "Enable EPEL Repository in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.6", "url": "/posts/RHEL-8_6-EPEL/", "categories": "documentation, configuration", "tags": "rhel, linux, os, repo", "date": "2022-08-11 09:00:00 -0500", "snippet": "Operating System: Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.6Installing EPEL RepoTo install the EPEL repository, login to the RHEL 8.6 server via SSH and run the following command:sudo dnf install https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-8.noarch.rpmYou will be prompted to import the GPG key for the EPEL repository.

You can download and run the script automatically using the command below.curl -sSL https://get.docker.com | shThis command downloads the install script from Docker’s site and pipes the file directly into the command line.Set Linux Permissions for DockerOnce Docker has completed its install, we need to modify some of the user permissions in Ubuntu.In order for the user to interact with Docker services, it needs to be added as a member of the Docker group.sudo usermod -aG docker your-userMake sure to replace “your-user” with the user that you want to allow Docker access to.Running PortainerOnce Docker has been installed and your user has been added to the docker group, it is time to get Portainer.We are going to run a Docker command to download the latest Portainer Docker image for the ARM processor.sudo docker pull portainer/portainer-ce:linux-arm64The final installation step will be to create and run the container for Portainer. If you are already using port 9000 on the device for something else, you will need to change the ports below.sudo docker run --restart always -d -p 9000:9000 -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -v portainer_data:/data portainer/portainer-ce:linux-arm64Now you should be able to navigate to the Portainer web console using the IP address of the device and port 9000.http://[DEVICE_IP_ADDRESS]:9000Configure PortainerOnce you have verified that you can reach the Portainer web console, we will need to setup a username and password.Once your account has been created, select the local environment option (in our case it’s labelled Get Started).You should now be connected to the Portainer home dashboard." }, { "title": "Useful Links", "url": "/posts/Useful-Links/", "categories": "documentation", "tags": "documentation, links", "date": "2022-07-29 01:00:00 -0500", "snippet": "Windows Find Disabled AD Accounts https://activedirectorypro.com/find-disabled-active-directory-user-accounts/ Create an HTML Report with PowerShell https://www.thelazyadministrator.com/2018/12/04/get-an-active-directory-interactive-html-report-with-powershell/ Install RSAT in Windows 10 https://theitbros.com/install-remote-server-administration-tools-windows-10/ Windows 10 Won’t Install .NET 3.5 Framework https://community.spiceworks.com/topic/2282574-need-fix-for-windows-10-won-t-install-net-3-5-framework Deploying Printers with Group Policy https://4sysops.com/archives/deploying-printers-using-group-policy/ PowerShell Script to Find Inactive Computers in Active Directory https://4sysops.com/archives/powershell-script-to-find-inactive-computers-in-active-directory/ How to Extend Windows Server 2016/2019/2022 Evaluation https://sid-500.com/2017/08/08/windows-server-2016-evaluation-how-to-extend-the-trial-period/ Reset RDS Grace Period in Windows Server 2016 https://www.vladan.fr/how-to-reset-120-day-rds-grace-period-on-2012-r2-server/ Find What Group Policies are Applied to Your Computer/Account https://www.howtogeek.com/116184/how-to-see-which-group-policies-are-applied-to-your-pc-and-user-account/ Unlock AD User Accounts with PowerShell https://www.prajwaldesai.com/unlock-user-accounts-with-powershell/ Use Group Policy to Install Software https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/windows-server/group-policy/use-group-policy-to-install-software Install Self-Signed Certificate on Workstations using Group Policy https://community.spiceworks.com/how_to/16832-installing-a-self-signed-certificate-on-workstations-with-group-policy-using-the-group-policy-management-console-gpmc Raise Active Directory Forrest and Domain Functional Levels https://theitbros.com/raise-domain-and-forest-functional-level/#:~:text=To%20raise%20the%20functional%20level,and%20click%20the%20Raise%20button.
