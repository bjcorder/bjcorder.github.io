Hello! My name is Brian Corder, and I am a technology professional.

Here you will find all of the documentation that I have made publicly available, including lists of my preferred tools and any professional projects or documentation that I find relevant. 

If you see something that needs fixed, this documentation is open source. Feel free to open an issue or PR [here](https://github.com/bjcorder/bjcorder.github.io).
